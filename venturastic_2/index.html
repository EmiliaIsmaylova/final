            <p>We sponsor Patient Capital and aim to back leaders from the marginalized communities who display determination, skills, imagination and understanding of what it takes to create change. Our program is designed to connect and cultivate a pipeline of entrepreneurs both Micro and Social who are committed to tackling poverty and injustice in their communities.</p>
            <p>Patient capital is not a grant, it is an investment which is intended to recoup its principal. It would not seek to maximize financial returns on its investment, as we seek to maximize social impact, to capitalize the creation of markets to combat poverty and give an opportunity for growth to both Micro and Social enterprise.</p>
            <p>With our patient capital program, we as the investor are willing to make a financial investment in a business with no expectation of turning a quick profit, instead investors will demand accountability in the form of return on capital and substantiated proof that the enterprise can grow sustainably in the long run. If we do have a very huge success story to share, we as a team would feel proud of being a part of that success.</p>
            <p>Each year we aim to invest in 2 projects as a Patient Capital Investor and back these projects with our expertise, business advisory and strategic support, to ensure that they succeed and become self-sustainable. </p>
