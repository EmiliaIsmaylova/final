              <p>Venturastic will organize financing for producers to finance marketing and distribution (“P&A”) costs so they will be able to hire distribution companies to distribute their motion pictures on favourable terms.</p>
            </div><br><br>
            <div class="paragraph">
              <p>Print and Advertising costs, are expenses incurred by a theatrical distributor prior to and during the promotion and exhibition of feature motion pictures theatrically.</p><br><br>
              <p>These costs include various forms of advertising including newspaper and television & radio ads as well as the cost of prints of the film that are projected in theatres. Venturastic will arrange financing for print and advertising costs for the theatrical release of feature motion pictures. Venturastic will evaluate completed motion pictures for such investments and also makes forward commitments for P&A at the time of production financing – in instances where Venturastic is financing production costs or is a part of other production financing arrangements. Forward commitments as this will enable producers to obtain higher presales and GAP financing as part of their production financing structure.</p><br><br>

              <p>We would aim to be the first call for companies who want to reclaim their lost grounds, by providing these brands the opportunity to restructure their companies, helping them to take measured risks to exit the loss phase, to regain the agility of a start-up while operating with the conduct of a public company, all while laying the ground for the future.</p>
